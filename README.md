#EcoDtaFlow Project
# EcoDataFlow  

### About the project  
This is my major project that I built to show a complete data pipeline and prediction system.  
It’s called **EcoDataFlow**, and it works on waste-management data from Indian cities.  
I created it fully in Python from scratch – it reads data from CSV, cleans and transforms it, stores it in a database, and then shows useful visualizations and predictions.  


### What I did  
- Built a full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and pandas  
- Cleaned and structured data before storing it in SQLite database  
- Created graphs to show city-wise and month-wise recycling performance  
- Used Linear Regression to predict recycling efficiency for the next 3 months  
- Automated everything so that the results are exported as charts and CSV files  

### Tools I used  
Python 3 | pandas | sqlite3 | matplotlib | seaborn | scikit-learn | GitHub  


### Results  
The outputs show:  
- Which city recycles the most waste  
- How the recycling trend changes every month  
- Future forecast graph for next 3 months based on past data  

All charts and CSVs are saved inside the **outputs** folder.  


### My note  
I wanted this project to look real and clean, not just theory.  
So I kept the data simple but the process advanced – complete flow from raw data → database → visualization → prediction.
